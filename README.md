# Counting-Sheeps

*In this project you can find some code writen with js language to develop a sheep counter*

>[!TIP]
>You can manipulate the list of sheeps or wolfs to have other answers, so you can try to remove all the sheeps from a list to see what happens.

>[!CAUTION]
>If you what to modify the list take into note that you dont have to modify any function of the code, if you make a little change in
>the functions, the sheepcounter may stop working.
